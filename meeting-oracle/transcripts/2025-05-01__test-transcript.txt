[00:01] Daniel: Alright, so we want to finalize the dashboard metrics today.

[00:03] Troy: Yep, and I also want to review the team’s feedback from last week. There were some really great points brought up.

[00:06] Daniel: Do you want to lead that section? You were in most of those breakout groups.

[00:09] Troy: Sure. One of the recurring points was how fragmented the follow-up process is.

[00:12] Daniel: Right, and we’re also lacking a proper feedback loop between meetings. That ties into the dashboard visibility issue too.
